# simple-city-builder
This is a game under development. It started as a project for a game jam with the theme of 'Diversity' however I have now changed to become a more simplified city builder.  
This was previously called 'diverse-city' however the name has now changed to reflect the design changes I have decided to make. The reasons for this are:  
* I am more motivated and interested in creating a game more focused on city building and management
* Would also be simpler to create the gameplay and mechanisms due to increased motivation as well as knowledge in this type of game.

# Core idea
This game is aiming to be a more simplistic city builder game, although I may add more complex elements to it in the future. You just mainly need to ensure you don't run out of pennies otherwise city go dead and gameover.
